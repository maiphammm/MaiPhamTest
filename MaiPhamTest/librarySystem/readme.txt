Library Management System
This is a simple JavaScript-based library management system. It allows users to add books to a library, check out and check in books, and display the current status of all books. The system handles book titles in a case-insensitive manner.

Features
Add Books: Add books with title and author to the library.
Check Out Books: Check out a book if it is available.
Check In Books: Return a checked-out book to the library.
Display Books: View a list of all books in the library with their current availability status.
Files
index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure and user interface for the library management system.
library.css: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements.
library.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for adding, checking out, checking in, and displaying books.
Setup
Download the Files: Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:

index.html

Open the HTML File: Open index.html in a web browser. You should see the user interface for the library management system.
